## First Update (22/12/2020)


### Is Covid-19 just another SARS?


When Covid-19 started spreading in early 2020 there was a lot of uncertainty about the seriousness of the virus. Some people were sounding alarm bells in January and February but most people either ignored this or played down the potential seriousness. As the reality of the situation began to emerge in March 2020 expert information about the potential impact of the virus was highly sought after. Scientific fields like epidemiology, virology, infectious diseases, immunology and public health were at forefront of information searches. Unfortunately so much of the pandemic has become politicised now but early on there was real hunger for expert analysis. As the pandemic grew further another problem emerged, finding information you could trust, amongst the misinformation generated by politicisation.


### Twitter as a global brain


Let's say a massive volcano erupted tomorrow. The fallout of the eruption was likely to affect global climate for years which would cause many downstream effects. Where would you go to quickly find a group of experts that provide analysis about this situation? Twitter is the only place I know of where experts in every scientific field have accounts and actively discuss news and research. Twitter is the closest thing we have to a <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/dimensions-of-t/">global brain</a>. When Covid-19 started becoming a global pandemic, Twitter quickly became the best place to find up-to-date scientific commentary and analysis.


### Twitter lists


We can group users on Twitter with lists. Lists on Twitter are very under-developed and hard to work with, but they provide the basic functionality of grouping users and viewing tweets just from this group. As the pandemic grew, lists on Twitter for scientists and experts related to Covid-19 started to emerge. But none of these lists looked exhaustive to me so I began to create my own version. 

Using the Twitter API I experimented with various ways of exploring a community of experts. Starting with a small group of 'starter' experts I found that the accounts that most of this group followed that also followed back a larger percentage of the starter group tended to be in the same area of expertise. This of course makes sense, a group of experts in a community would tend to follow each other. Using this heuristic I quickly generated candidates for different fields relevant to the pandemic like epidemiology, virology, infectious diseases, immunology and public health. I manually checked each account to ensure it looked legitimate before adding it to a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1290732445008982016">list of Covid-19 scientists and experts</a>. The list now has over 600 members.

Now that I had a group of experts I knew I could trust I needed a way to parse and organise the information related to Covid-19. The list view on Twitter only provides a stream of tweets, making it impossible to keep up to date with the most important and relevant information. Some basic information processing features that make lists more powerful: full text search (with filtering on date ranges), sorting based on measures like the most retweets, replies and likes (including restricting this to just list member interactions), extraction of links, clustering of tweets that are about the same news story or sub-topic. I would need to build these features to surface the the most useful information related to the pandemic.


### Building aggregation


The first step to aggregating tweets from the list of Covid-19 scientists was to pull in raw tweets from the list. Unforunately the Twitter API doesn't return tweets in a neat package containing all the retweets, quotes tweets and replies around a central tweet, so I needed to write code to create this aggregation from all the tweets coming from a list. I used MongoDB to cache tweets returned from the API and Apache Airflow to create a DAG over the ETL steps. MongoDB was the most natural fit to store JSON responses from the Twitter API and quickly add new fields from processing. Tweets were processed into a higher-order aggregation that captured all tweets that mentioned the same link, with each tweet also organised into a group that included all retweets, quote tweets and replies from list members. 

After this, each aggregation of tweets was passed through a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipleline to classify tweets related to Covid-19 and also tag classification labels for sub-issues relating to the pandemic like vaccines, immunity, contact tracing, testing etc. I have a lot of experience working with NLP classification using all sorts of methods including the latest Transformer models like BERT and RoBERTa, but in this case a simple n-gram matching solution with some basic preprocessing was sufficient for the first version.

The final step was to create full-text search index over all the tweets. I used the excellent <a href="https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html">Whoosh</a> library to create a fast and easy index in Python. This offered more features than just using full-text search in MongoDB and was a way more lightweight option compared to something like <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a>. 


### Website


Using the processed aggregations I designed the website with the following features:

* Digest of top links that have the most interactions from the list (interactions in terms of original tweets from list members). Aggregated over two time periods, last 48 hours and last 7 days
* View of all Covid-19 classified tweets from the list, with filtering on sub-issues, filtering of tweets that contain links, date range filtering and sorting on date and list member interactions
* Full-text search over all Covid-19 tweets with filtering and sorting

The website is built with Flask, Bulma for CSS and jQuery/javascript.


### Bot


I also created a Twitter bot (<a href="https://twitter.com/CovidExpertList">@CovidExpertList</a>) that retweets the top Covid-19 tweets from the list every day.
