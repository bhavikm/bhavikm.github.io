Hey there, I'm a data scientist based in Melbourne, Australia. 

I've been working in data science, machine learning and software since 2012. In the last 3 years I have developed extensive experience and interest in Natural Language Processing, especially with the application of Transformer models. My background in software engineering provides an invaluable asset in working as a data scientist. I'm constantly learning and building to push my skills and expand my knowledge. 

Currently available for new work in data science or machine learning engineering (particularly with a focus on NLP). Please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> if you would like to work together.

* Working with the radar data processing software component team doing development, bug fixes, testing, writing docs, contributing to technical discussions
* Required a strong understanding of mathematical algorithms (Kalman filters) that were at the core of the software system

#### Jan 2014 to Jul 2014 - Research Machine Learning Engineer at Monash University Faculty of I.T.
* Implemented research ideas for Bayesian networks into an existing C++ machine learning research library


### Education
* Master of Applied I.T., Machine Learning, Monash University
	* Specialisation in Machine Learning. I was awarded two research scholarships to support machine learning research in the Faculty of I.T.
* Bachelor of Science, Major in Mathematics, Monash University
	* Major in Mathematics. Minors in Computer Science and Physics.


### Courses
I enjoy expanding my knowledge in different areas of data science, machine learning and software engineering. Below are courses I've completed on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>.
* Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and Models (with Honours)
* Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis
* Startup Engineering

* Computing for Data Analysis
* Machine Learning


### Side Projects
I love creating small software projects that solve problems I have in my own life, with the hope it can generalise to more people experiencing the same problem. These projects are very personally fufilling and have provided the opportunity to learn some complementary skills in design, web development, marketing, sales and product management. Checkout the <a href="/projects">projects</a> page for what I've made.
