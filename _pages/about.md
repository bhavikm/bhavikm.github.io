Hey there, I'm a data scientist and developer based in Melbourne, Australia. I'm currently looking for my next opportunity in data science or machine learning engineering. Please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> if you would like to work with me.

#### Previous roles
* Jan 2020 to Current - Freelance data science and working on some <a href="/projects">projects</a>
* Mar 2017 to Nov 2019 - Data Scientist at Monash University
* Jan 2015 to Mar 2017 - Software Engineer at Thales (Air Traffic Control Systems)
* Jan 2014 to Jul 2014 - Research Machine Learning Engineer at Monash University Faculty of I.T.


#### Education
* Master of Applied I.T., Machine Learning, Monash University
	* Specialisation in Machine Learning. I was awarded two research scholarships to support machine learning research in the Faculty of I.T.
* Bachelor of Science, Major in Mathematics, Monash University
	* Major in Mathematics. Minors in Computer Science and Physics.


#### Courses
I enjoy expanding my knowledge in different areas of data science, machine learning and software engineering. Below are courses I've completed on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>.
* Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and Models (with Honours)
* Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis
* Startup Engineering
* Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1
* Natural Language Processing
* Computational Investing, Part 1
* Human-Computer Interaction

#### Side Projects
I love creating small software projects that solve problems I have in my own life, with the hope it can generalise to more people experiencing the same problem. These projects are very personally fufilling and have provided the opportunity to learn some complementary skills in design, web development, marketing, sales and product management. Checkout the <a href="/projects">projects</a> page for what I've made.
